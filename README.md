## Abstract
This work consists of the study and development of a web application to visualize
the temporal evolution of planets such as Earth using computer graphics.
Each chapter of the document introduces a new concept or functionality which
together form a simplified model in order to recreate the development experienced
by the planet, from its formation to the present day, by exploring the various
mechanisms that led it to be as we know it today.

Some of these are the birth of the protoplanet in the initial formation period, the
origin of water, oceans and rivers and the erosive effects they produce on the soil,
the formation and movement of tectonic plates, the effects of the light as it traverses
an atmosphere and disperses and how climate works on a global scale, among other
things. As described in the document, simulating all these phenomena is a very
complex task and many simplifications have been made in order to make this project
viable.

The ultimate goal is not to try to simulate the planet Earth, as it is a great complex
task and with countless variables, instead, we want to explore the idea of
implementing in a simplified way what we know about our planet, and others, to
obtain approximate results that can be extrapolated to see what other habitable
planets like ours might look like, or create totally unique others with very different
characteristics.
